# Devnotes
Development related stuff for html-specialchars goes here - it's all about 
keeping the production repository on npmjs.com as lean as possible.


## Contributing
Please take care to maintain the existing coding style.  
Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code.  
As windows user it could be necessary to install the **devDependencies** globally 
using the  `-g` switch.


## Compiling
html-specialchars is developed in **ECMAScript 2015** intentionally and therefore 
lives in the **es6 folder**. For hassle free usage and testing - including coverage -
it is transpiled back to ECMAScript 5 for now. This is done by the command below,
(re)placing **index.js** in the root folder:

```shell
  npm run compile
```


## Documentation
The (really sparse ;-) documentation is generated by the current development 
version of jsdoc (as of July 2015) which e.g. supports the new ES6 class 
definition. For this reason **the npm script runs against the ES6 source file**.

```shell
  npm run jsdoc
```


## Tests
This project uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) (properly speaking the 
[jasmine-node module](https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node)) for testing 
and [istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) for code coverage.

Important hint for windows users: for running under the windows environment 
it's necessary to supply the full relative path of both CLIs. 
This results in a separate test method:

```shell
  npm run test
  npm run test-windows
```
