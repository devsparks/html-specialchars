# html-specialchars
A small library providing utility methods to `escape` special characters
to their HTML entities  
as well as `unescape` their corresponding entity/numeric character 
references back to chars.

## The escaped (&#8594;) and unescaped (&#8592;)

### 1. Syntax characters
There are three characters that should always appear in content as escapes, 
so that they do not interact with the syntax of the markup. These are part 
of the language for all documents based on XML and for HTML.

`&` &#8596; `&amp;`  
`<` &#8596; `&lt;`  
`>` &#8596; `&gt;`  

`&` &#8592; `&#38;`  
`<` &#8592; `&#60;`  
`>` &#8592; `&#62;`  


### 2. Quotations 
`"` &#8596; `&quot;`  
`'` &#8596; `&apos;`  
&nbsp;\`&nbsp; &#8596; `&#96;`  

`"` &#8592; `&#34;`  
`'` &#8592; `&#39;`  
&nbsp;\`&nbsp; &#8592; `&DiacriticalGrave;`  

There is still (2015) information around, that 
> [...] `&apos;` not recommended because its not in the HTML spec -  
> for this reason the XHTML specification recommends instead the  
> use of `&#39;` [...]

This refers to HTML 4.01 and should be obsolete with todays HTML 5.


### 3. OWASP Recommendation

## Installation
```shell
  npm install html-specialchars --save
```


## Usage
```javascript
  var html_specialchars = require('html-specialchars');

  var unsafeUserInput = 'Oh yes, <script>while(1);</script> I really enjoyed your party!';
  var safeString = html_specialchars.escape(unsafeUserInput);
  var plainTextAgain = html_specialchars.unescape(safeString);

  console.log('User input', unsafeUserInput, 'Escaped', safeString, 'Unescaped', plainTextAgain);
```


## Compiling
html-specialchars is developed in **ECMAScript 2015** intentionally and therefore 
lives in the **es6 folder**. For hassle free usage and testing - including coverage -
it is transpiled back to ECMAScript 5 for now. This is done by the command below,
(re)placing **index.js** in the root folder:

```shell
  npm run compile
```


## Tests
This project uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) (properly speaking the 
[jasmine-node module](https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node)) for testing 
and [istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) for code coverage.

Important hint for windows users: for running under the windows environment 
it's necessary to supply the full relative path of both CLIs. 
This results in a separate test method:

```shell
  npm run test
  npm run test-windows
```


## Documentation
The (really sparse ;-) documentation is generated by the current development 
version of jsdoc (as of July 2015) which e.g. supports the new ES6 class 
definition. For this reason **the npm script runs against the ES6 source file**.

```shell
  npm run jsdoc
```


## Contributing
Please take care to maintain the existing coding style.  
Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code.  
As windows user it could be necessary to install the **devDependencies** globally 
using the  `-g` switch.
